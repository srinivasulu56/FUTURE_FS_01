      <p className="text-dim leading-relaxed text-lg">
        Hey! I'm <span className="text-textLight font-medium">Srinivasulu</span>, a full stack developer with a strong drive for building things that are clean, efficient, and purposeful. 
        I enjoy diving deep into both frontend interfaces and backend systems — the entire journey from a blank screen to a fully functional app gets me excited.
      </p>

      <p className="text-dim leading-relaxed text-lg mt-4">
        I started my journey with basic HTML & CSS, just out of curiosity. That curiosity quickly turned into a passion — leading me to explore 
        <span className="text-textLight"> JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS</span> for the frontend and 
        <span className="text-textLight"> Django, Python</span> for the backend. 
        Now, I enjoy building full-stack applications that solve real problems or automate boring stuff.
      </p>

      <p className="text-dim leading-relaxed text-lg mt-4">
        What I really love is the **logic** — breaking problems into parts, optimizing algorithms, and making code reusable and efficient. 
        I have a strong grip on data structures and algorithms, and I often find myself tweaking solutions just for the fun of it.
      </p>

      <p className="text-dim leading-relaxed text-lg mt-4">
        Beyond just code, I'm fascinated by the design decisions that make products feel intuitive. 
        I care deeply about building accessible, responsive, and fast web experiences. 
        I enjoy adding subtle animations, working with CSS-in-JS, and experimenting with AOS and Framer Motion for interactive UIs.
      </p>

      <p className="text-dim leading-relaxed text-lg mt-4">
        Outside of coding, I'm always learning — from reading documentation to watching deep dives on system design and performance optimization. 
        I also enjoy teaching what I know and collaborating with other developers on ideas that make us better.
      </p>

      <p className="text-dim leading-relaxed text-lg mt-4">
        Whether it’s crafting a slick frontend, building a secure backend, or optimizing code for performance, I bring my full energy into every task. 
        I believe good code solves problems, but great code empowers people.
      </p>

      <p className="text-dim leading-relaxed text-lg mt-4">
        Right now, I'm focused on sharpening my full-stack skills, contributing to open-source, and working on personal projects that push my limits. 
        I’m excited about the future — and always open to new challenges, collaboration, and growth.
